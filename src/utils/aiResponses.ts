1. Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts
2. Hold your breath for 7 counts  
3. Exhale through your mouth for 8 counts
4. Repeat 3-4 times

This naturally activates your parasympathetic nervous system and signals "safety" to your body. Focus only on counting - let other thoughts drift away like clouds.

Try this right now, and notice how your body starts to feel more relaxed.`;

1. Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts
2. Hold your breath for 7 counts

This technique works by increasing carbon dioxide in your blood, which naturally calms your nervous system. It's like a natural sedative!`;

3. If yes, write one small action for tomorrow
4. If no, remind yourself: "This worry will still exist tomorrow if I need it, but right now is time for rest"

- Get sunlight within 30 minutes of waking
- Gentle movement (even just stretching)
- Hydrate with water (not just coffee)

- Some can become habit-forming

- Melatonin (timing is important)
- Magnesium supplements
- Valerian root or chamomile tea
- CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia)
